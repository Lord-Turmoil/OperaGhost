An email bot to send email automatically with a predefined schedule.

## Overview

It will automatically fetch quotes from [ZenQuotes.io](https://zenquotes.io/).  You can also manually set content of the email. It uses `Template.html` as a template, and insert quotes or other html inside. When the time comes, it will send email to all contacts.

It is still in development, so I **always** enable Swagger UI to make tests easier.
